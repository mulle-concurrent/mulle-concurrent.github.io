# mulle-concurrent

The mulle-concurrent library collection is written for C11. It is bases on
[mulle-c](//github.com/mulle-c). It provides a few wait-free/lock-free 
datastructures. The underlying platform thread library is abstracted 
using mulle-thread. The problem of thread-safe memory reclamation is handled
by mulle-aba.
